# CodeIgniter 4

This project is a frontend application built with CodeIgniter 4, featuring a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface. It allows users to interact with data seamlessly from the frontend, performing operations like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting records. With CodeIgniterâ€™s MVC architecture, the project efficiently separates the backend logic from the user interface, ensuring clean and organized code. This setup provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for managing data and integrates well with various back-end databases supported by CodeIgniter 4.
